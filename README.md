# Implementation-of-Search-Algorithms-Depth-First-Search-DFS-Maze-problem

This repository contains an implementation of search algorithms, specifically focusing on solving a maze problem using Depth First Search (DFS). The program is designed to navigate through a maze by finding a path from a designated start point 'A' to a goal point 'B'. It uses a stack-based frontier to explore possible routes, keeping track of visited states to avoid re-exploration. The code is structured with classes that represent key elements of the maze-solving process, such as nodes (which store individual states), a frontier (which manages the states to be explored), and the maze itself (which stores the layout and controls the logic for navigating through it). The Maze class includes functionality for reading and displaying the maze, identifying walls, and determining the solution path. The solution is found by continuously exploring unvisited neighboring cells until the goal is reached, after which the program traces back the path and can output both the solution and a visual representation of the maze. The repository is an educational example of how DFS can be applied to solve complex pathfinding problems in a structured and efficient manner.
